			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been bouncing back between wireless Keychron K2 and wired Corsair K65 Lux. Keychron is a bit too tall and my wrist would get tired after while. K65 was overall great, but had a really thick cable and not very good crossplatform support. 
Recently came across the new K65 Plus Wireless and picked it up today on sale. Wow, really impressed and I fully expected to not like it.</p>
<ul>
<li>I always thought that red switches would be loud and that&rsquo;s not the case at all. Really enjoy the key travel and how quiet it is.</li>
<li>It is really compact and is shorter than both K2 and wired K65.</li>
<li>Has markings for both Mac and Windows as well as an easily readable Windows/Mac switch (K2&rsquo;s is very difficult to read).</li>
<li>Really nice layout and heft for both productivity and gaming, which lacked a bit with both K2 and K65 Lux. The both leaned in too far into 1 direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how the board feels after a few days, but so far so good!</p>

			 <p>I‚Äôve been on the hunt for 20KG kettlebells for a while now. Unfortunately, trying to find them used has been pain. People ghost, respond and then stop, have unreaasonable pricing for rusted equipment. It‚Äôs been really disappointing.</p>
<p>Tired of all of the above, I just pulled a trigger on 3 bells from REP. Seems like kettlebell kings are never in stock and prices they charge are insane.</p>

			 <p>For about 2 years I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MLB51ZS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">MikroTik hAP ac3</a> to run my home network. As I learned more about networking, I got more frustrated with limitations of Google Mesh (as well as data collection). RouterOS is definitely not easy and I have banged my head against the wall numerous times, but I considered it good for the sake of learning.</p>
<p>Now, last week I added a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09H2CCVZX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">MikroTik Cap XL ac</a> to the family. A friend of mine is making fun of me that I&rsquo;m about to have a ceiling mounted AP, but the speed is worth it!</p>
<p>Last night I finally got it fully set up. The challenge with RouterOS documentation is that there are multiple versions since different devices use different licenses. Thus, finding a page that is up to date and applicable to your device is not always simple. 
I set up CAPsMAN and after a few reboots on the AP, everything finally clicked. The AP found the CAPsMan server and now I can control all the settings from the main router.</p>
<p>The range of the network has definitely grown and it&rsquo;s not even mounted on the ceiling yet. The connection in the garage has always been barely existent, and I already see a dramatic difference.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been playing with <a href="https://midjourney.com">Midjourney</a> for the past few days. It is <strong>definitely</strong> not perfect, however when it&rsquo;s good it&rsquo;s <strong>scary good</strong>.</p>
<p>Some prompts simply don&rsquo;t work, for example</p>
<blockquote>
<p>imagine an infographic with directions on how to parallel park</p>
</blockquote>
<p>produced a totally unwanted result.</p>
<p>However, if we use this prompt</p>
<blockquote>
<p>imagine a toon style Grim Reaper that doesn‚Äôt know anything, clueless, high def resolution, ray tracing lighting, funny</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the produced result was about 90% perfect and you won&rsquo;t really find imperfections until you really look for them.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used it to generate some tattoo ideas, which were decent, but only about 60% of what I actually added in the prompt. Browsing the gallery of the images from the community there are absolutely stunning examples. When I look at those descriptions they are a lot more precise than mine, which means one must know how to ask this machine to do things vs me just poking around.</p>

<p>I was mostly unprepared and haven&rsquo;t spent enough time rehearsing the speech, so in many ways I was &ldquo;winging it&rdquo; in the moment.</p>
<p>I started out calmly, but as I progressed, I became super nervous. At some point I thought i will pass out :D But the audience (about 12 people in person and 3 remote) said I didn&rsquo;t come off nervous at all, which is a great compliment.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really proud of myself. This felt very different than speaking in a meeting and I am looking forward to improving this skillset.</p>

<p>I had 2 relatively crappy weeks preparing coming up to the retake, so I did not feel super confident. Material was mostly familiar, but the process was tough. 150 questions, 4 hours, no going back.</p>
<p>The biggest help on this 2nd attempt was the official app. I picked it over Pocket Prep to ensure accuracy, and it was definitely sufficient. Will use it again when studying for CCSP!</p>

			 <p>When I switched from Google Suite to Fastmail, I began liking email again. Fastmail&rsquo;s interface is fast and simple. The updates are consistent and it has almost all of the features I would need. It&rsquo;s cheaper than Gsuite.
The only glaring negative was the lack of integrations, but I can live without those.</p>
<p>However although cheaper, FastMail is still $80 for two users while Zoho mail is $30. So for the past few weeks I switched to Zoho and have been trying it out.</p>
<p>It didn‚Äôt last. We are back to FastMail. Here is why:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Major Issue is Zoho UX.</strong> They have serious readability issues for their inbox. Fonts make it difficult to distinguish read and unread, and the entire inbox appears cluttered. There are no options to change font sizes either, so everything kind of blends in.</li>
<li><strong>Unified inbox for external accounts is missing.</strong> I love that in FastMail I can fetch emails from other providers and they all come to the same inbox. Zoho separates these into separate accounts. I‚Äôd have to set up forwarding rules for everything to go to the same place which adds friction.</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard addresses.</strong> FastMail handles this fantastically. I can create a new ‚Äúfrom‚Äù address right in the compose screen. In Zoho I had to go to the admin console to create a new one. So if I signed up for a service with ‚Äúalias@domain.com‚Äù, although I could receive that email I‚Äôd have to create it in the admin console in order to respond with it. FastMail wins hands down here.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, we know cheaper is not always better. But different, is not always better either.
Zoho has a lot going for it but it created more friction to my workflow and it just is not suited for my needs.</p>

			 <p>I bought a used mini fridge, stocked it with favorite drinks, and I‚Äôve never felt richer.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve always been really focused on not having sodas and juices around the house. In my eyes those things are unnecessary, budget busters, and of course not healthy. But they are a nice treat once in a while!</p>
<p>Sometimes we would buy those things, be it coconut water, sparkling waters, or something similar. Beer from time to time, or even diet sodas. It was always a nice treat to have one, even with the negatives, in moderation it would be great to have it as an option around the house</p>
<p>But I recently decided that in moderation. It is nice to offer it to guestss that come over. And I didnt expect how rich it made me feel.</p>
<p>I think this is where Ramit Sethi comes to mind. This is not an expensive thing, but it really made our life a little richer.</p>

			 <p>Ran into some issues updating calibre-web on my Synology server. After trying to update to version 6.20, I began receiving the following errors:</p>
<p><code>&quot;flask-limiter&quot; is needed for calibre-web to run. Please install it using pip: &quot;pip install flask-limiter&quot;</code></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><code>ImportError: cannot import name 'CronTrigger' from 'cps.services.background_scheduler' (/calibre-web/app/cps/services/background_scheduler.py)</code> .</p>
<p>Thankfully nothing too major, and these two quick commands fixed it:</p>
<p><code>pip install flask-limiter</code></p>
<p><code>pip install apscheduler</code></p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a few days since joining Micro.blog. I remember hearing about the platform on a podcast quite a few years ago, but I completely forgot it existed.
I&rsquo;ve been using Jekyll and Github pages quite successfully for a few years, but I found my workflow to be a bit tedious and that if I didn&rsquo;t do anything with the site besides posting, with the next update or design change something would break. I&rsquo;m not a Ruby expert, nor do I want to be, so it became a headache.</p>
<p>There are 2 main observations about Micro.blog:</p>
<ol>
<li>The community aspect is something that deserves a ton of recognition. This is, indeed, a place where you do want to write. The brief interactions have been great, and the community is very interesting. I love the fact that there is an actual community manager and weekly community events.</li>
<li>Boy are some things not user friendly. This platform has a long way to go before it can be used by regular, non techie folks. Documentation is lacking and in some places is out of date. Without Hugo knowledge things are just <strong>hard</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, the community aspect is outweighing the negatives. Once I&rsquo;ll get to the point where my tinkering is satisfied with the way the site is set up, I can see myself sticking around here for a while and building on top of this platform.</p>

			 <p>I made a switch from a gas car to an electric RWD vehicle. I&rsquo;ve never driven an electric vehicle before and only been in one once. After a week of ownership I have a few thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="i-totally-get-it">I totally get it</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great. It&rsquo;s the fastest car I&rsquo;ve ever driven as the torque is insane. The top speed is supposed to be 140MPH, but i&rsquo;m not going anywhere near that. Merging onto highways and overtaking other cars when needed is a breeze.
I was told I will miss the engine noise and vibrations from the lack of the engine but it hasn&rsquo;t been the case for me. The road noise is comfortable and it&rsquo;s quieter than the previous car. The vibrations from the engine was exactly what I never liked as it is (i&rsquo;m pretty sensitive to anomalies in car sounds and it just added stress to my daily driving knowing that something might be wrong with the car ).
Adding a level 2 charger at home also made a massive difference. It is extremely convenient and is about 1/3rd of the gas prices.
The car also came with the Tesla Supercharger included. Even though my car is limited in speed of charging due to it&rsquo;s age, knowing that I can charge for free on any road trip is great.</p>
<h2 id="its-basically-a-phone-with-wheels">It&rsquo;s basically a phone with wheels</h2>
<p>Everything is an app or via a touch screen. This part is pretty annoying.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlock doors without fob? touchscreen</li>
<li>Unlock charging port? either app or touchscreen inside the car.</li>
<li>Want to change windshield wipers? dig through the touchscreen menu to put them in &ldquo;service mode&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are apps and games, and fart noises? And i&rsquo;ve had to soft reset the car several times which is also unusual.
But in general, there are too many examples to list of where standard features that traditional car manufacturers have via a button are buried in the software for no good reasons. With my car being 10 years old there are improvements that they have made on newer versions, however in some instances (AC vents) they took away the manual ability to change direction and hid them in software.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>Very happy. I got a deal from a friend and I am overall very happy with the decision. The break even point is over a year but this calculation does not consider the fun factor that I am having driving this car. Surprisingly, lack of transmission opens up the space a lot, allowing my dog to fit in better and join us on more trips. And with having a hatch AND a frunk, we can actually fit more into the vehicle than our SUV.</p>

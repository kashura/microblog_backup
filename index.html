			 <p>A few days ago I received an email that .me domains are going up in price. Unfortunate, not happy about it, and .me is already quite more expensive than .com, net, .org. But it is what it is.</p>
<p>Side note: I only just learned that .me is not as in ME the individual, but ME as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.me">Montenegro</a>. Oops! But better late than never.</p>
<p>After receiving the email I wasn&rsquo;t too bothered in the grand scheme of things (<em>ah yea another thing that&rsquo;s more expensive now, sigh</em>), until I noticed that <a href="https://namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> will charge me $22.98 on renewal. So a registration of a new domain was going up by $1, while renewal was going up by $2. I decided to look around and understand how that price aligns and what Reddit has to say about this and stumbled on <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heard about <a href="https://porkbun.com/">Porkbun</a> before but haven&rsquo;t considered it seriously as I didn&rsquo;t have a reason to move my domains. After finding this <a href="https://porkbun.com/blog/upcoming-price-increases/">Upcoming Price Increases</a> page I was sold by transparency, but also what appears less of a markup. Not only that, but it appears that Namecheap was already more expensive, charging me about $19 for renewals, while Porkbun is $2 cheaper even before the price hike.</p>
<p>At this point, and without further thinking, I moved 3 of my main domains to Porkbun, and renewed them all for 8 more years. This will be my registrar of choice going forward!</p>
<p>P.S. I&rsquo;ve had a few domains sitting in the cart in Porkbun for the last few days. They have not gotten removed and they are there every time I log in. Namecheap would reset these. Was not a fan.</p>
<p>Porkbun also has a simple wishlist feature which I also dig.</p>

			 <p>For the past few years I’ve began putting effort into avoiding software that is not cross platform.</p>
<p>I am tired of the lock in. I don’t want to think about what software I won’t be able to use if I leave the Apple ecosystem.
Conceptually, I understand the reasoning behind it not only for Apple, but for the companies choosing to build their business around Apple products. And in general, software that is available on Apple platforms tends to have better UX and polish, while costing more. According this article, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/06/iphone-users-spend-apps/">iPhone users spend 7x more on apps over Android users.</a>. No wonder developers are investing into the ecosystem!</p>
<h2 id="current-example">Current example</h2>
<p>I am writing this post on a trial version of <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a>. It is a great writing application that costs $50 (non subscription) per platform. Interestingly, it costs $50 each for Apple and iPhone/iPad, but $30 for the Windows version. Not sure what is the driver behind that difference.</p>
<p>As much as I am enjoying it, and in addition to price, I don’t want to spend $100 on software that I might need to repurchase. I’m currently using iPhone 15 and M2 MacBook Pro, but I’ve dabbled with the switch to Android and would consider <a href="https://frame.work/">Framework</a> as my next laptop. I do think that Apple MacBooks provide the best computing experience out of the box, but I am not sure I want to be paying the <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2130071/entry-level-m3-macbook-pro-8gb-memory-ram-performance.html">outrageous prices for RAM</a> and storage upgrades.</p>
<h2 id="lock-in-apps">Lock in apps</h2>
<p>This list is pretty short and is dictated by using an iPhone, which makes iMessage the main dependency.
I use Obsidian for my notes (even though it is too much for my use case) over Bear or similar, due to it being cross platform. I switched to Garmin for fitness tracking and Immich for photo library (mainly as a back up).
I don’t use Safari, and rely on Fastmail native calendar. Almost everything else is cross platform albeit with a few, minor in the grand scheme of things, exceptions.</p>

			 <p>Haven&rsquo;t been this stumped in a while.</p>
<p>I moved my gaming PC to a new case, and it would not power on. Click and nada.</p>
<p>I tried everything I could think of with PSU being the main suspect. 
I took everything out on the table, connected, and it worked. 
I put it back in the case - same story. Nada.</p>
<p>Took me about 8 hours to figure out that a fan hub that came with the case was shorting the the motherboard.</p>
<p>I should&rsquo;ve figured this out sooner and I should&rsquo;ve been testing after each step.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m definitely a dabbler. Sometimes it&rsquo;s time well spent, and often its a form of procrastination.</p>
<p>If i am being honest, it&rsquo;s probably more often a form of procrastination. And my hope is that if I was to objectively look back, that I have learned more from doing it than the opportunities i&rsquo;ve lost by doing it. In a way, these projects are a proof of my continuous learning and skillset that I&rsquo;m acquiring.</p>
<p>Alright, that kind of feels like a weird way to start a post. Let&rsquo;s get back to it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to build a NAS for a long time. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to be &ldquo;more technical&rdquo; my entire career in IT and that&rsquo;s the main reason why I got into it. I thought it&rsquo;s awesome to build these digital things that can connect to each other and make things happen and work. So after I built my first gaming PC in 2020 I&rsquo;ve been planning on building a server.</p>
<p>I have a 2 bay Synology NAS that has great software, but the hardware is so ridiculously underpowered! It worked well for a while but the performance was really underpowered, and Synology uses a proprietary format for their documents, so it was useless as a replacement for Google Docs/OneDrive.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year when Unraid changed their license pricing, I purchased a license just in case and in July I upgraded my gaming PC to the AM5 platform and that left me with AM4 parts. As black friday and cyber monday came along, I began looking for the missing parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A PSU ( power supply unit)</li>
<li>A CPU fan.</li>
<li>Case fans.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it, that&rsquo;s really all I needed. And I even had a couple of spare HDDs that I also ear marked for this, although I was using them in the Synology.</p>
<p>The set up was really straightforward and I got everything up and running very quickly. I am amazed at how much more user friendly many settings are and how much easier it is to find support/write ups for more complex topics. Unraid has an amazing community and the Community Store is also a gem.</p>
<p>This is it for now, but I have a lot to share about my dabbling with Unraid.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently gone down a few rabbit holes around iPhone to Android switch and then today I went down a Paprika vs Mela one. I ended up purchasing both Paprika apps for iOS and Mac and started tinkering around and reading thoughts on Reddit.</p>
<p>I came across a couple of posts about how Paprika is a nightmare for privacy. All I could think to myself was &ldquo;how bad could it possibly be&rdquo; and went and looked at the <a href="https://www.paprikaapp.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: it&rsquo;s an insane policy for a recipe app. It&rsquo;s extremely broad, links and ads clicked on are not covered by the policy, and the weird clause about age&hellip;I was shocked.</p>
<p>Ran this through Claude to get a summary, and this is what Claude gave back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Major Overreaches:</p>
<p>Collects postal addresses and phone numbers (unnecessary for recipe app)
Has broad access to device files and photos beyond recipe needs
Shares data with undefined &ldquo;subsidiaries and affiliates&rdquo;
Allows behavioral advertising tracking
No clear data retention or deletion policies</p>
<p>📱 Excessive Data Collection:</p>
<p>Mobile network information
Traffic data and communication logs
Broad device metadata access
Multiple tracking technologies (web beacons, cookies)
IP addresses and detailed device identifiers</p>
<p>🤝 Concerning Sharing Practices:</p>
<p>Broad rights to share with contractors and service providers
Can transfer all user data if company is sold
Allows multiple third-party analytics companies to collect data
No clear limits on how third parties can use the data
No protection guarantees for shared family recipes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quickly submitted a request for refund to Apple and went with <a href="https://mela.recipes/">Mela</a>. Want to know Melas privacy policy?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mela does not collect any data. If iCloud Sync is enabled, your data is stored securely in a private container in your iCloud account. Mela does not depend on or use any third-party service.</p>

<p>Apple to Google Photos transfer tool is just as bad as Google Photos to Apple. Not everything transferred and a lot of photos got moved over without meta data. Very frustrating and extremely disappointing.</p>
<p>Besides convenience, trusting Apple or Google with your photos is a major risk. Nobody wants to end up with thousands of photos that are now missing key meta data such as date taken.</p>

			 <p>For all the freedoms we talk about in the US, we surely do love being held hostage to corporations.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t had a streaming subscription in a while and when we do we only watch sports. Soccer being the dominant sport and then sprinkled with NFL, college football, and NHL playoffs. It is absolutely baffling how many different services you&rsquo;re required to pay for to watch a sport!</p>
<p><em>OG Football aka soccer:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Cable subscription to catch NBCSN, ABC, USA, and sometimes NBC.</li>
<li>Peacock for many PL games.</li>
<li>Paramount+ Champions League and Europa League and some other random matches.</li>
<li>ESPN+ for many cup ties (FA cup) and Bundesliga/La Liga.</li>
<li>Apple TV+ MLS package for MLS games (and this is the most reasonable offering of all of the above, as you get every single match for the entire season).</li>
</ol>
<p><em>NFL:</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Cable for CBS, NBC, FOX in local markets to see a local team.</li>
<li>NFL Sunday Ticket for games not carried by local broadcasts.</li>
<li>Amazon Prime for Thursday Night Football.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Hockey:</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s such a mess that it is not worth even listing out. The bottom line is that I cannot watch my local NHL team for less than $20/mo and for nationally broadcasted games I need to pay for ESPN+, or have subscriptions to see TNT, ESPN, and ABC.</p>

			 <p>My annual <a href="https://fastmail.com">FastMail</a> subscription expires in December and I have been paying for FM for 3 years now. If i stick around, this will be the 4th year. Somewhere in my drafts I have a blog post sitting about how much FM has improved my relationship with email and how much I was enjoying it. Recently I began thinking through if FM is the right subscription to keep forward and began doing research on the email market. </p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-in-email">What do I need in email</h2>
<p>It often feels like my usage of email and paying for it is a throwing money away. I have a work email that I use for my job and my friends seem to be completely happy using firstlast1223@gmail or something similar. Yet, here I am using purchased domain names, adding catch all addresses, and assigning a specific email to each service. But, overall, here is a simple list of features that I am looking for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Professional and short email handle. </li>
<li>Shared calendars. </li>
<li>Shared mailbox set up to share with my spouse.</li>
<li>Ability to send and receive via personal domains.</li>
<li>BONUS: my spouse and I use the same platform. </li>
</ol>
<p>Yea, that&rsquo;s pretty much it. Looking at it now it all seems so simple!</p>
<h2 id="options">Options</h2>
<p>The first place I looked were the regular suspects: Gmail and Outlook. Both cost about the same for 2 users, and both require having the business version of the account to be separate from the personal one. That means using personal Gmail for YT and other services, while using Gsuite for the extra features. Very similar with Outlook as a personal Office 365 subscription cannot be changed into a business one. <br>
I quickly abandoned Office business as an option due to how complex MSFT makes any account management. Google still remains an option, but kind of a last case scenario. If Gmail is where I end up going, that means I&rsquo;m really going to stick with FastMail over that move. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also considered free versions of these services, but I can&rsquo;t get handles that accomplish my number 1 requirement. I feel like some time back I used to have firstlast@gmail but lost it. Emailing that address led nowhere. </p>
<p>Besides Gmail and Outlook other feasible options were Proton Mail and&hellip;FastMail. Again, FM is really awesome and there is a lot to like there. It&rsquo;s still an option, but I&rsquo;m looking to try something different. <br>
There are plenty of other email options from StartPage, to Posteo, to Tutanota&hellip;but all have cons, and considering that my ideal scenario is my spouse and I using the same platform, the learning curve might be too steep. </p>
<h2 id="here-comes-hey">Here comes Hey</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve looked at <a href="https://hey.com">Hey.com</a> about a year ago, but dismissed it for being half baked and really expensive. Now, it has become&hellip;an option? Let&rsquo;s review:</p>
<ol>
<li>Professional and short email handle.  - Yes, available!</li>
<li>Shared calendars.  - Yes!</li>
<li>Shared mailbox set up to share with my spouse. - YIKES!</li>
<li>Ability to send and receive via personal domains. - YIKES!</li>
<li>BONUS: my spouse and I use the same platform. - Yes&hellip;?</li>
</ol>
<p>I won&rsquo;t focus on the wins, but let&rsquo;s talk about the YIKES!</p>
<h2 id="yikes-number-1">Yikes Number 1</h2>
<p>Although Hey now offers a <a href="https://www.hey.com/families/">Family plan</a>, it&rsquo;s not really a family plan. When you buy a <a href="https://support.1password.com/explore/families/">1Password for Families</a> plan, it comes with a shared vault that allows you to share the passwords with others. FastMail allows to create a shared email address and a shared inbox for that address that other users on the account can utilize. I assumed that if Heys Family plan allows 4 accounts, that something like that would be viable and I grabbed an email handle for our family. But it turns out it&rsquo;s a feature that is completely missing. The best Hey offers right now is linking your 2nd email account to another account, but that is it, and you cannot share it beyond that. </p>
<p>The reason why this is a pretty big feature for us is because of school. We get emails from teachers and the school district, and a shared mailbox in FastMail allowed us to know that one of us has seen it and took action. We also used it to communicate with the school and it was easy keep up. Great use case for us and without this feature in Hey, we now need to identify if having 2 addresses for the school to use is a detriment or makes no difference at all. </p>
<h2 id="yikes-number-2">Yikes Number 2</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a big yikes mostly because of sticker shock. Currently, i pay $80/year with FastMail for 2 accounts and 3 domains. That&rsquo;s pretty good! <br>
Hey would cost me $30/month for the same amount of domains. And it wouldn&rsquo;t cover my spouse (another $100). And each Hey account can only be associated with 1 domain, and no this is completely separate from Hey for Families. </p>
<h2 id="yikes-number-3">Yikes Number 3</h2>
<p>Hey doesn&rsquo;t import old email. And okay, I kind of get it, fresh start and all that. But I might have a receipt that I need to find from not so distant future. Or, a correspondence that I want to continue.<br>
It&rsquo;s not the end of the world, but it feels like an unnecessary friction point and I think the reason behind it (fresh start) is a marketing attempt to cover the technical challenge. If users begin importing thousands of old emails, it doesn&rsquo;t fit neatly into <a href="https://www.hey.com/the-hey-way/">The Hey Way.</a></p>
<h2 id="in-summary">In Summary</h2>
<p>Hey is pretty cool. It&rsquo;s different and opinionated, and <a href="https://email-is-good.com/2024/04/30/just-thinking-about-hey/">this blog post</a> by Chris Coyier summarizes my feelings about the service SO WELL. It&rsquo;s missing features, and it&rsquo;s expensive. It has a learning curve and requires a buy in from my spouse. </p>
<p>I kind of rushed an paid even before my 30 day trial was up. I assumed that paying will give me that shared address, that shared environment that I was looking for. The customer service has been great, so hopefully they will hear me out if within a few weeks we identify that this is not for us.</p>

			 <p>This post is not about Musk, it&rsquo;s about Tesla.</p>
<p>I just finished my 3rd road trip of the year, with over 5000 miles driven up and down the East Coast. There is no other EV on the market that you can reliably take on a road trip. Rivian is coming the closest, yet only because of the Tesla super charger network.</p>
<p>The availability of the chargers is unparalleled and Tesla is a lot more aggressive about the speed of charging vs other manufacturers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Model Y - 250kW</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Rivian R1T - 180kW</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Ford Mach-e - 160kW</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the most recent trip that spanned about 21 hours of driving, the total charging time was 3 hours. Google maps estimated it to be about a 9.5 hour trip each way in a gas vehicle and in my ICE vehicle it would require almost 2 tanks of gas to get to the destination. I think it is fair to say that optimistically, with stops for gas, restroom, and food would require about 45 minutes at minimum. It feels like a very optimistic estimate, but if using that as a baseline, driving an EV only added 90 minutes round trip. This is not bad at all!</p>
<p>The longest stop on the last trip was 52 minutes, which only was this long due to how busy the restaurant was. We charged up to 96% which is not what we would usually do on a trip. Usually you get to 65-75% and leave. And the shortest stops were 4 and 7 minutes.</p>
<p>In total, we stopped 10 times round trip with an average of 18 minutes per stop. The amount spent on superchargers was $114.35 cents.</p>
<p>If your road trip style is to drive non stop until the tank is empty - EVs are definitely not it. But that&rsquo;s also not an enjoyable approach to me. I appreciate taking a little stretch/break while the car is charging. It&rsquo;s a nice way to break down the drive, and it works out even better when you stop for a meal.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been bouncing back between wireless <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K2</a> and wired <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/keyboards/ch-9110010-na/k65-lux-rgb-compact-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-cherry-mx-rgb-red-ch-9110010-na">Corsair K65 Lux</a>. Keychron is a bit too tall and my wrist would get tired after while. K65 was overall great, but had a really thick cable and not very good crossplatform support.
Recently came across the new <a href="https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/keyboards/ch-91d401l-na/k65-plus-wireless-75-percent-rgb-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-ch-91d401l-na">K65 Plus Wireless</a> and picked it up today on sale. Wow, really impressed and I fully expected to not like it.</p>
<ul>
<li>I always thought that red switches would be loud and that&rsquo;s not the case at all. Really enjoy the key travel and how quiet it is.</li>
<li>It is really compact and is shorter than both K2 and wired K65.</li>
<li>Has markings for both Mac and Windows as well as an easily readable Windows/Mac switch (K2&rsquo;s is very difficult to read).</li>
<li>Really nice layout and heft for both productivity and gaming, which lacked a bit with both K2 and K65 Lux. The both leaned in too far into 1 direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how the board feels after a few days, but so far so good!</p>

			 <p>For about 2 years I&rsquo;ve been using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MLB51ZS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">MikroTik hAP ac3</a> to run my home network. As I learned more about networking, I got more frustrated with limitations of Google Mesh (as well as data collection). RouterOS is definitely not easy and I have banged my head against the wall numerous times, but I considered it good for the sake of learning.</p>
<p>Now, last week I added a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09H2CCVZX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">MikroTik Cap XL ac</a> to the family. A friend of mine is making fun of me that I&rsquo;m about to have a ceiling mounted AP, but the speed is worth it!</p>
<p>Last night I finally got it fully set up. The challenge with RouterOS documentation is that there are multiple versions since different devices use different licenses. Thus, finding a page that is up to date and applicable to your device is not always simple. 
I set up CAPsMAN and after a few reboots on the AP, everything finally clicked. The AP found the CAPsMan server and now I can control all the settings from the main router.</p>
<p>The range of the network has definitely grown and it&rsquo;s not even mounted on the ceiling yet. The connection in the garage has always been barely existent, and I already see a dramatic difference.</p>

			 <p>When I switched from Google Suite to Fastmail, I began liking email again. Fastmail&rsquo;s interface is fast and simple. The updates are consistent and it has almost all of the features I would need. It&rsquo;s cheaper than Gsuite.
The only glaring negative was the lack of integrations, but I can live without those.</p>
<p>However although cheaper, FastMail is still $80 for two users while Zoho mail is $30. So for the past few weeks I switched to Zoho and have been trying it out.</p>
<p>It didn’t last. We are back to FastMail. Here is why:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Major Issue is Zoho UX.</strong> They have serious readability issues for their inbox. Fonts make it difficult to distinguish read and unread, and the entire inbox appears cluttered. There are no options to change font sizes either, so everything kind of blends in.</li>
<li><strong>Unified inbox for external accounts is missing.</strong> I love that in FastMail I can fetch emails from other providers and they all come to the same inbox. Zoho separates these into separate accounts. I’d have to set up forwarding rules for everything to go to the same place which adds friction.</li>
<li><strong>Wildcard addresses.</strong> FastMail handles this fantastically. I can create a new “from” address right in the compose screen. In Zoho I had to go to the admin console to create a new one. So if I signed up for a service with “alias@domain.com”, although I could receive that email I’d have to create it in the admin console in order to respond with it. FastMail wins hands down here.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, we know cheaper is not always better. But different, is not always better either.
Zoho has a lot going for it but it created more friction to my workflow and it just is not suited for my needs.</p>

			 <p>I bought a used mini fridge, stocked it with favorite drinks, and I’ve never felt richer.</p>
<p>I’ve always been really focused on not having sodas and juices around the house. In my eyes those things are unnecessary, budget busters, and of course not healthy. But they are a nice treat once in a while!</p>
<p>Sometimes we would buy those things, be it coconut water, sparkling waters, or something similar. Beer from time to time, or even diet sodas. It was always a nice treat to have one, even with the negatives, in moderation it would be great to have it as an option around the house</p>
<p>But I recently decided that in moderation. It is nice to offer it to guestss that come over. And I didnt expect how rich it made me feel.</p>
<p>I think this is where Ramit Sethi comes to mind. This is not an expensive thing, but it really made our life a little richer.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s been a few days since joining Micro.blog. I remember hearing about the platform on a podcast quite a few years ago, but I completely forgot it existed.
I&rsquo;ve been using Jekyll and Github pages quite successfully for a few years, but I found my workflow to be a bit tedious and that if I didn&rsquo;t do anything with the site besides posting, with the next update or design change something would break. I&rsquo;m not a Ruby expert, nor do I want to be, so it became a headache.</p>
<p>There are 2 main observations about Micro.blog:</p>
<ol>
<li>The community aspect is something that deserves a ton of recognition. This is, indeed, a place where you do want to write. The brief interactions have been great, and the community is very interesting. I love the fact that there is an actual community manager and weekly community events.</li>
<li>Boy are some things not user friendly. This platform has a long way to go before it can be used by regular, non techie folks. Documentation is lacking and in some places is out of date. Without Hugo knowledge things are just <strong>hard</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>But, the community aspect is outweighing the negatives. Once I&rsquo;ll get to the point where my tinkering is satisfied with the way the site is set up, I can see myself sticking around here for a while and building on top of this platform.</p>

			 <p>I made a switch from a gas car to an electric RWD vehicle. I&rsquo;ve never driven an electric vehicle before and only been in one once. After a week of ownership I have a few thoughts.</p>
<h2 id="i-totally-get-it">I totally get it</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great. It&rsquo;s the fastest car I&rsquo;ve ever driven as the torque is insane. The top speed is supposed to be 140MPH, but i&rsquo;m not going anywhere near that. Merging onto highways and overtaking other cars when needed is a breeze.
I was told I will miss the engine noise and vibrations from the lack of the engine but it hasn&rsquo;t been the case for me. The road noise is comfortable and it&rsquo;s quieter than the previous car. The vibrations from the engine was exactly what I never liked as it is (i&rsquo;m pretty sensitive to anomalies in car sounds and it just added stress to my daily driving knowing that something might be wrong with the car ).
Adding a level 2 charger at home also made a massive difference. It is extremely convenient and is about 1/3rd of the gas prices.
The car also came with the Tesla Supercharger included. Even though my car is limited in speed of charging due to it&rsquo;s age, knowing that I can charge for free on any road trip is great.</p>
<h2 id="its-basically-a-phone-with-wheels">It&rsquo;s basically a phone with wheels</h2>
<p>Everything is an app or via a touch screen. This part is pretty annoying.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlock doors without fob? touchscreen</li>
<li>Unlock charging port? either app or touchscreen inside the car.</li>
<li>Want to change windshield wipers? dig through the touchscreen menu to put them in &ldquo;service mode&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are apps and games, and fart noises? And i&rsquo;ve had to soft reset the car several times which is also unusual.
But in general, there are too many examples to list of where standard features that traditional car manufacturers have via a button are buried in the software for no good reasons. With my car being 10 years old there are improvements that they have made on newer versions, however in some instances (AC vents) they took away the manual ability to change direction and hid them in software.</p>
<h2 id="verdict">Verdict</h2>
<p>Very happy. I got a deal from a friend and I am overall very happy with the decision. The break even point is over a year but this calculation does not consider the fun factor that I am having driving this car. Surprisingly, lack of transmission opens up the space a lot, allowing my dog to fit in better and join us on more trips. And with having a hatch AND a frunk, we can actually fit more into the vehicle than our SUV.</p>
